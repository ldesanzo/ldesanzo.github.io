<p><i>[ HYALURONIC ACID MOISTURIZER ]</i> With hyaluronic acid, ceramides and MVE technology for 24 hour hydration. Rich, velvety texture that leaves skin feeling smooth, it is absorbed quickly for softened skin without greasy, sticky, feel.</p>

<p><i>[ ESSENTIAL CERAMIDES ]</i> Ceramides are found naturally in the skin and make up 50% of the lipids in the skin barrier. All CeraVe products are formulated with three essential ceramides (1, 3, 6-II) to help restore and maintain the skinâ€™s natural barrier.</p>

<p><i>[ DRY SKIN RELIEF ]</i> A deficiency of ceramides in skin can often be associated with dry skin, which can feel itchy and look flaky. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream was shown to increase the skin's level of ceramides after 4 weeks.</p>
